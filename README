NOTES
Em likes the idea of installing the lights on the slanty part of the ceiling/wall for a big ring of light on her ceiling.
Power efficiency is a priority.
Ease of deinstallation at end-of-life is a priority.
Em's room is 15'x17'
Em's slanty thing has a hypotenuse length of 36" and a rise length of 15"
These measurements are ***approximate***.
